# Binary Classification with a Bank Dataset using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements a binary classification task on a bank dataset using Logistic Regression. The goal is to predict a binary outcome based on the features of the dataset.

## Dataset
- **Source**: www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e8

## Requirements
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`.

## Implementation
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data loading, cleaning, and preparation for modeling.
2. **Modeling**: Logistic Regression implemented using `scikit-learn`.
3. **Evaluation**: Model accuracy of **87.74%** on the dataset.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Run the script for data preprocessing and model training.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 87.74%
